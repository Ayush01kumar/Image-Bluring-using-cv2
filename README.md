This project demonstrates how to apply image blurring techniques using OpenCV in C. It includes the implementation of Gaussian, Box (average) blur filters to reduce noise and detail from images.
#  Image Blur using OpenCV in C

This project demonstrates how to apply various **image blurring techniques** using **OpenCV in C**. It includes implementations for **Gaussian**, **Median**, and **Box (Mean)** filters to reduce image noise and smooth details.

##  Features

- Load and process images using OpenCV.
- Apply and compare different types of blur:
  -  Gaussian Blur
  -  Median Blur
  -  Box (Mean) Blur
- View output results and understand their effects on image clarity.
